# Email-SMS-Spam-Classifier
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying emails and SMS messages as spam or non-spam. The goal is to create an efficient and accurate classification system that can help in filtering out unwanted and potentially harmful messages.

# Project Overview
Objective: Develop a classification model to differentiate between spam and non-spam emails/SMS messages.

Dataset: The project utilizes a labeled dataset containing a collection of emails/SMS messages, categorized as spam or non-spam.

Data Preprocessing: Perform text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, removing stop words, and applying stemming or lemmatization techniques.

Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the text data, such as bag-of-words representation or TF-IDF vectors.

Model Development: Train and evaluate various machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, etc

Performance Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model for real-time prediction using a web application or API.
